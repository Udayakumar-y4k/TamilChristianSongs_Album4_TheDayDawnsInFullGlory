This powerful song contrasts the futility of man-made idols (Isaiah 44:9–20) with the majesty of the true God — Creator, eternal King, and living Rock. Idols are lifeless, blind, mute, and doomed to dust; the Lord is holy, mighty, merciful, and unchanging. The song calls us to worship the One who made everything and alone deserves all praise.
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, true Divine and eternal King,
deliver us from every idol and false worship.
You alone are holy, mighty, and merciful.
We praise You — Creator of heaven and earth.
Let all creation resound with Your glory.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
