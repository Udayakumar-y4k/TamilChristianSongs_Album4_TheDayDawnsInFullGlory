This triumphant song of praise echoes Hannah’s prayer of victory (1 Samuel 2:1–10), rejoicing in God’s salvation, sovereignty, and reversal of fortunes. The Lord, the Holy One, the Rock, humbles the proud, lifts the lowly, breaks bows, gives strength, and grants glory to His anointed. It calls the remnant to exult in His deliverance, trusting His unchanging justice.
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, Rock of our salvation,
let our hearts rejoice in You alone.
Lift us from the dust, exalt us in Your mercy.
Break every pride and every foe.
We praise You — the Holy One, forever faithful.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
