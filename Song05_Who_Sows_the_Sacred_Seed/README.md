This song faithfully retells the Parable of the Sower (Matthew 13:1–23), where Jesus explains the four types of soil and the fate of the sacred seed (God’s Word). The enemy steals, trials wither, worries choke, but good soil yields abundant fruit. The sower is Jesus, the seed is His Word, and the harvest is eternal life. The song calls us to be good soil, producing 30, 60, 100-fold fruit for His glory.
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, Great Sower of the Word,
let Your sacred seed fall on the good soil of our hearts.
Protect us from the enemy, trials, and worldly cares.
Let us yield abundant fruit — thirty, sixty, a hundredfold.
We seek You alone.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
