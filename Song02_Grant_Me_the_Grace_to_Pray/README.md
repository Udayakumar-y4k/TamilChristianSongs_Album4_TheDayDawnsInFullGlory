This powerful prayer song pleads for the gift of intercession and the Spirit’s empowerment, echoing Luke 11:13 (Father gives the Holy Spirit to those who ask). It seeks strength to overcome enemies, break idolatry, heal the lame and mute, restore the body, grow in faith and wisdom, study the Word, and live like Jesus — all through the Spirit’s anointing. The song is a cry for prayer as a weapon and holy living in the final hour.
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, Giver of the Spirit,
grant us the grace to pray without ceasing.
Fill us with the Spirit of intercession.
Empower us to overcome every enemy.
Let us live holy as You lived.
Come quickly and anoint us anew.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
