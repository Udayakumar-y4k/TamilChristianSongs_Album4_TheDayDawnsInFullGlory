This powerful call to seek Jesus echoes Matthew 7:7 — “Seek and you will find.” It urges breaking Satan’s snares, overcoming in battle, freedom from sin’s burden, deep study of the Word, victory over temptation, and ultimately finding and glorifying Jesus. Seeking Him is the path to everything — deliverance, truth, and eternal life.
Closing Prayer for the Listener
Lord Jesus Christ, the One worth seeking,
draw us to search for You with all our hearts.
Break every snare of the enemy.
Set us free from sin and curse.
Let us find You and glorify You forever.
ஆமென். அல்லேலூயா!
